I mostly stare into the abyss. (Un/Re)-Learning Dasein (German translation to "Existence").

### Hello! I am Nish.

But you can call me **Paradox** because life is itself a paradox for me.

If you don't like calling me **Paradox**, you can call me **Gru** because I look like him and I am as evil as Gru.

I am just another dot in a dot trying to "live" among the absurdities of life. I mostly call myself a nihilist, but I get emotional on a lot of things, especially getting a lot of existential crises.

In hindsight, I am a pile of atoms coming together to form broken thoughts. So yeah! That's that. :/

### Here's something about me

Let me be ego-centric just this time. If people who, in all seriousness, ask me about myself, here are few things I'd say:

- I am currently pursuing my MS in CS at University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant with [NASA-IMPACT](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/impact) lab where I deal with quirky research!
- I am trying to exist among Chaos, Caffeine and Code (and Words)
- I am interested in applied Machine Learning, Programming, Software Engineering, Algorithms, Optimizations and Data Science
- I tend to phase out (and in) of this world. But for the sake of arguments, assume I am right here in this blog, within randomness of words, reflecting from my mind-cave.
- There were more things I used to be interested in. Not now. Perhaps, I might again. You will never know. :)
- Most of the time, I feel like an observer moving in and out, observing things (and entities) as events unfold. I feel like a highly caffeinated silhouette.
- I am just trying to see where the river flows with the help of the indefiniteness of words residing in this blog
- Last but profoundly, I am highly influenced by Feynman. That should give you some idea about an **abstraction** of me (Abstractions are leaky, alright!)

For other things about life, love, romance, tragedy and all the proses that evoke a sense of existential crises, I have my mind-cave: [Nish Mind-Cave](https://nish1001.github.io/mind-cave/)
