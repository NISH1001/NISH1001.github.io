## Notes
 - Coffee provides very significant quantities of [[Magnesium]], as well as other nutrients including [[Vitamin B1]]

 - [[Nutrition]] science is neglected more

 - treat non-[[Systems Thinking]] with caution

 - the line between nutrients and biological modifiers often depends on the situation

 - [[Vitamin A]], [[Vitamin D]] have [[Hormone]]-like properties

 - poisons can stimulate [[Hormesis]]
	 - food restriction can extend [[Longevity]]

 - If [[Nutrients]], used in isolation, used as [[Drugs]]
	 - for a specific purpose for organism

	 - normally not eaten as a component of ordinary food

	 - [[Non-Essential Nutrients]]

 - Bad reputation of [[Coffee]]
	 - because of high doses in short period of time

	 - [[Palpitation]]

 - ~~Coffee causes Fibrocystic~~ [[Breast]] ~~disease~~
	 - [[Caffeine]] now used with some of the standard [[Cancer]] treatment

 - [[Caffeine]] can increase [[Progesterone]]

## HN Notes
 - **Can an exogenous molecule that was so adaptive be missed this bad and now consuming it will just fill that gap we had for millions of years?**
	 - from [[Human]] [[Evolution]] history, [[Calories]] were scarce
		 - Caffeine increases [[Metabolism]]
			 - kind of bummer for our [[Hunter-Gatherer]] ancestors

 - in overdose, everything is a [[Poison]]
	 - [[Example]]
		 - if you drink it quickly enough - for example eight litres over three hours was enough to kill someone.

 - [[Nicotine]] without smoke is still harmful
	 - hardening of [[Artery]]
		 - [[Heart Attack]]

 - **only you can detect good health by paying attention and making decisions in real time, and that the optimal combo will always be in flux**

## My Thoughts
- This is a bit obscured read (more like a self-research from the Author with "pretty" [[Chemical]] jargon. Personally, I loved a thing or two here.

- It's interesting to find the history of nutrients in the essay. However, as always, the positive and negative effects of [[Caffeine]] intake are still fuzzy. Personally, I agree to > Bad reputation of [[Coffee]] because of severe [[Palpitation]] it causes when taken in high doses (this coming from personal experiences past 3-4 years).
- In hindsight, it's how much [[Tolerant]] you are for caffeine. 
	- For me it's high and sometimes I get too anxious with high doses. Normal doses for me seem to be a high dose for a few people I have interacted with.

	- Too much of anything is not that good.
- All I can say is, it all depends on situation how you use it. The case with Coffee drinkers having low incidence of [[Suicide]] just isn't digestible, at least for me. Maybe, there's a serious [[Synchronicity]] in the two.

- Anyway, I have a [[Love]] and [[Hate]] relationship with [[Caffeine]]. :)
