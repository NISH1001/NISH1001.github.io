- Notes
	- I liked Ted Chiang's stories. It's very apparent that his atheism are reflected on his stories, especially the story **Hell Is the Absence of God**
	- Some of the stories I loved in priority
		- Story of your life
			- This is the story from which [[Movie/Arrival]] was based from.
			- I liked how the narration in the story has superposition of present, past and future
				- I mean the writing structure itself is how the main protagonist (the narrator in the story) got influenced from the aliens (hexapods) while understanding their own languages
		- Understand
			- This is also a nice story, where the main character developed super intelligence and super awareness of everything
			- The ending could have been better
				- Instead of having a battle to another human just like the main character, it could have been symbiotic
		- Tower of Babylon
			- I also liked how Ted Chiang took **Flat Earth Theory** literally and experimented on what it would feel for a human to climb this infinite tower
			- I liked the ending because the universe is cylindrical.
				- So, when the main character reaches the top and gets drown in the water, he ends up back to the earth's surface
