Learned about Coffee so much from this [TED Talk video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8meCjVsJWI)

## Notes
- Coffee beans are actually extracted from a coffee cherry. Two methods to extract beans
    - Wash
        - Beans extracted beforehand from the cherry
        - Beans washed through water to separate out unwanted cherry outer layer and beans
        - Beans dried on sun for some weeks
        - Doesn't have much taste of the cherry because beans are extracted in the first stage itself
    - Ferment
        - Cherry is kept on sun for fermentation for couple of weeks
        - Once dried, beans are extracted
        - The fermentation will also affect the inside bean
        - Provides more original sweeter taste of coffee cherry
- Coffee usually grown based on aerobic/anaerobic reaction
    - Low altitude (aerobic)
        - Under low altitude
            - Indonesia
        - Think normal respiration while doing exercise
        - Beans are closer to their original cherry taste
    - High altitude (anaerobic)
        - Under high altitude
            - Ethopia
        - Think high intensity respiration
        - Glucose + Lactic acid in absence of air
            - Lactic acid adds flavor for creaminess and fruit-like acidity
                - balances out original bitterness
- Roast
    - Roastness level determines what chemicals gets broken down in the beans
    - Maillard reaction
        - Exothermic Chemical reaction?
            - Based on heat intensity, generates amino acid
            - Gives acidic taste?
