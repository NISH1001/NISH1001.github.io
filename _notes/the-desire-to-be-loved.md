## Takeaways
- **We hide to be loved** - We crave deep connection but often hide our "messy," vulnerable selves behind a mask of generally attractive qualities, fearing our true selves won't be accepted.
- **Narcissism limits connection** - Wanting to be loved only for the things we admire about ourselves (like looks) is like "tickling yourself." Real love is when someone cherishes the parts of you that you didn't even think were lovable, like bed hair or strange thoughts.
- **Worship isn't love** - Trying to live entirely *for* someone else or making them the "god" of your life just creates resentment and avoids the responsibility of your own freedom.
- **Solitude vs. Partnership** - While solitude avoids the messiness of others, life is often better shared. The goal isn't to live *above* or *below* someone, but simply to live *with* them.
- **Conflict is intimacy** - The awkward moments, bickering, and "clumsiness of being" aren't failures of love; they are often the most real points of connection where the masks finally slip off.

## My Thoughts
- This hits hard
- Sometimes I feel like I don't have a sense of *belonging* anywhere. But that's okay.
