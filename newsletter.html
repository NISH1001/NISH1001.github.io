<h2>"Bits and Paradoxes"</h2>

<p>I maintain a weekly newsletter <b>Bits and Paradoxes</b>where I share various contents I encounter in my life — essays, podcasts, videos, books, discussion threads, ideas, poetry, music, and other fascinating things.</p>

<p>I tend to be more “contemplative” on topics touching the universe, life, and existence. So, you might encounter some existential crises scattered here and there in bits… It’s a way for me to reinforce my mental models and knowledge to connect the dots at best.</p>
