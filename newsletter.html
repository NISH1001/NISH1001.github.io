<h2>"Bits and Paradoxes"</h2>

<h3>Hi, I’m Nish!</h3>

But you can call me Paradox because life is itself a paradox for me.
<br/>

If you don't like calling me Paradox, you can call me Gru because I look just like him.
<br/>

I’m just another dot int a dot trying to live among the absurdities of life.
<br/>

Through this newsletter Bits-and-Paradoxes I want to share relevant content I encounter with annotations and personal thoughts. Contents range from articles, podcasts, videos, discussion threads, and such. It’s a way for me to reinforce my mental model and knowledge base to connect the dots at best.
