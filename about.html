<h2>Hello! I am Nishan Pantha.  </h2>

<p>But you can call me <b>Paradox</b> because life is itself a paradox for me.</p>

<p>If you don't like calling me <b>Paradox</b>, you can call me <b>Gru</b> because I look like him and I am as evil as Gru.</p>

<h2>Here's something about me</h2>

<ul>
    <li>I am somewhere lost in Chaos, Caffeine and Code (and Life)</li>
    <li>(Unluckily) I am a Computer Engineer.</li>
    <li>I am an AI/ML/DL enthusiast.</li>
    <li>I tend to phase out (and in) of this world.</li>
    <li>To be honest, one finds “interests” as something that gives life to working mechanisms. I love programming in general. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Here's something about the blog</h2>
The blog is all about the things I have in my mind:

<li> Programming</li>
<li> AI and Machine Learning</li>
<li> Technology</li>
<li> Philosophy</li>
<li> Life</li>
<li> Love</li>
<li> Music</li>
