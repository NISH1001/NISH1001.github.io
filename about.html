<h3>Hello! I am Nish.  </h3>

<p>But you can call me <b>Paradox</b> because life is itself a paradox for me.</p>

<p>If you don't like calling me <b>Paradox</b>, you can call me <b>Gru</b> because I look like him and I am as evil as Gru.</p>

<p>I am just another dot in a dot trying to "live" among the absurdities of life. I mostly call myself a nihilist, but I get emotional on a lot of things, especially getting a lot of existential crises.</p>

<p>In hindsight, I am a pile of atoms coming together to form broken thoughts. So yeah! That's that. :/<p>

<h3>Here's something about me</h3>
Let me be ego-centric just this time. If people who, in all seriousneess, ask me about myself, here are few things I'd say:
<br/>
<br/>

<ul>
    <li>I am trying to exist among Chaos, Caffeine and Code (and Words)</li>
    <li>I am interested in applied Machine Learning, Programming, Software Engineering, Algorithms, Optimizations and Data Science</li>
    <li>I tend to phase out (and in) of this world. But for the sake of arguments, assume I am right here in this blog, within randomness of words, reflecting from my mind-cave.</li>
    <li>There were more things I used to be interested in. Not now. Perhaps, I might again. You will never know. :)</li>
    <li>Most of the time, I feel like an observer moving in and out, observing things (and entitites) as events unfold. I feel like a highly caffeinated shilhouette.</li>
    <li>I am just trying to see where the river flows with the help of the indefinitess of words residing in this blog</li>
    <li>Last but profoundly, I am highly influenced by Feynman. That should give you some idea about an <b>abstraction</b> of me</li>
</ul>

For other things about life, love, romance, tragedy and all the proses that evoke a sense of existential crises, I have my mind-cave:

<p>Oh! I also maintain a weekly newsletter <b>Bits and Paradoxes</b></p>
