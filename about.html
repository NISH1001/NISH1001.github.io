<h3>Hello! I am Nish.  </h3>

<p>But you can call me <b>Paradox</b> because life is itself a paradox for me.</p>

<p>If you don't like calling me <b>Paradox</b>, you can call me <b>Gru</b> because I look like him and I am as evil as Gru.</p>

<p>I am just another dot in a dot. So yeah!<p>

<h3>Here's something about me</h3>
Let me be ego-centric just this time. If people who, in all seriousneess, ask me about myself, here are few things I'd say:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
    <li>I am trying to exist among Chaos, Caffeine and Code (and Words)</li>
    <li>(Unluckily) I am a Computer Engineer. :/</li>
    <li>I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, Algorithms and Mathematics in general</li>
    <li>I am more attracted to Natural Language Processing, partly because I find myself getting trapped in philosophy, literature
        and programming, every now and then.</li>
    <li>I tend to phase out (and in) of this world. But for the sake of arguments, assume I am right here in this blog, within randomness of words, reflecting from my mind-cave.</li>
    <li>There were more things I used to be interested in. Not now. Perhaps, I might again. You will never know. :)</li>
    <li>Most of the time, I feel like an observer moving in and out, observing things (and entitites) as events unfold.</li>
    <li>I am just trying to see where the river flows with the help of the indefinitess of words residing in this blog</li>
    <li>Last but profoundly, I am highly influenced by Feynman. That should give you some idea about an <b>abstraction</b> of me</li>
</ul>

<h3>Here's something about the blog</h3>
The blog is all about the things I have in my mind:

<li>Programming</li>
<li>AI, Algorithms and Mathematics</li>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Philosophy</li>
<li>Life</li>
<li>Love</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Universe (I guess)</li>
