<h2>Hello! I am Nish.  </h2>

<p>But you can call me <b>Paradox</b> because life is itself a paradox for me.</p>

<p>If you don't like calling me <b>Paradox</b>, you can call me <b>Gru</b> because I look like him and I am as evil as Gru.</p>

<h2>Here's something about me</h2>

<ul>
    <li>I am trying to exist among Chaos, Caffeine and Code (and Words)</li>
    <li>(Unluckily) I am a Computer Engineer. :/</li>
    <li>I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, Algorithms and Mathematics in general</li>
    <li>I am more attracted to Natural Language Processing, partly because I find myself getting trapped in philosophy, literature
        and programming, every now and then.</li>
    <li>I tend to phase out (and in) of this world. But for the sake of arguments, assume I am right here in this blog, within randomness of words, reflecting from my mind-cave.</li>
    <li>There were more things I used to be interested in. Not now. Perhaps, I might again. You will never know. :)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Here's something about the blog</h2>
The blog is all about the things I have in my mind:

<li> Programming</li>
<li> AI, Algorithms and Mathematics</li>
<li> Technology</li>
<li> Philosophy</li>
<li> Life</li>
<li> Love</li>
<li> Music</li>
<li>Universe (I guess)</li>
